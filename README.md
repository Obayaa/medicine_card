This project is a pure HTML and CSS project.
I joined the Slightly Techie School 100 Days of code and along the pocess i was tasked to redesign this project:

Of which i obliged and the content of this repo is my solution hosted on vercel: https://medicine-card.vercel.app/

The HTML contains the structure for the UI with div representing each section.
The CSS was used for the styling of the divs, classes and ids present in the code.

A bit of JS was included to cause an onclick event when the edit schedule button is clicked on. This was an extra attachment i added to make the app responsive to clicks and not static.
